This app lets you search for events in your city. You can see how many events are happening in a particular place and timeframe, the details of those events, and even what types of events are most common in an area.

Within this project, I will be using serverless functions because it is fast and easy to deploy any updates to the app and it is cost efficient as it only costs what is used.
